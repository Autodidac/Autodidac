# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Rushford @Autodidac

[![Subscribe To My Youtube For Updates!](/images/youtube.png?raw=true)](https://youtube.com/adamrushford)





I think it's safe to take down my under construction warning... avoid actually using projects marked with WIP (work in progress) you can star or watch them for now and use them when that tag is removed.

I've completely rebuilt the Job System and CrossView from the ground up and work on all repos continues, Almond Engine is going to be released alpha 0.0.1 in the next few weeks.
I just want to give a little update because the repos are a bit archaic at the moment.

I’m a passionate 40-something-year-old game developer with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Lua.

I specialize in contemporary C++ and enjoy working with C++20, eagerly anticipating C++23 with its exciting new features like modules. As an Autodidact Independent Game Developer, I am now well on my way building my own open source free game engine for use in my projects and everyone else's!!!!

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and innovate through my projects. Some of the highlights include:

- **[CrossView](https://github.com/Autodidac/CrossView)**: A Bare Bones Crossplatform Entrypoint Library
  
  A system similar to xwindow in the spirit of Modern C++ as a core crossplatform software development base. (vc studio + vs code)


---
- ---|| **[Almond Core](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondCore)**:

 A system inspired by allowing others to create beautiful things with the core of a game engine and allow them to create their own rendering systems while leveraging the power of Almond Engine.
 

---

- -------|||  **[Almond Shell](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondShell)**:
                    
A system inspired by the concepts of Java JRE, AutoRun executables, Ultimate X Programs, and Modular systems, Almond Core + A Plugin Mod System to disable the limits of creativity with Almond Engine and Almond Core.
                     

---

- -----------|||| **[Almond Engine](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondEngine)**:

 An x64-bit Crossplatform C++20 Modern Game Engine. For literally everyone and everything.

- **Modular System Development**: I love designing modular systems that seamlessly integrate and interact with each other, laying a strong foundation for future projects.

I am driven by a surge in productivity, thanks to a certain digital assistant that has been instrumental in making development life much more enjoyable.

### 🌱 Always Learning

I thrive on learning new things and constantly improving my skills, especially in the realms of game development and high-performance programming. I'm always open to exploring cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of what can be achieved.

### 🎯 Goals

- Continue expanding my knowledge in contemporary C++ and explore C++23's new features.
- Develop more sophisticated tools and engines for game development.
- Foster a community of like-minded developers to collaborate on exciting projects.

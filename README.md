I’m A Passionate Autodidactic Xennial Independent C++ Game Dev and Tuber with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Lua.

I specialize in C++ Game Engine and Game Design and eagerly anticipate C++23 with its exciting new features like modules. As an Independent Game Developer, I am now well on my way building my own open source free game engine for use in my projects and everyone else's!

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and innovate through my projects. Some of the highlights include:

- -------|||  **[Almond Shell](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondShell)**:
                    
A system inspired by the concepts of Java JRE, AutoRun executables, Ultimate X Programs, and Modular systems, Almond Core + A Plugin Mod System to disable the limits of creativity with Almond Engine and Almond Core.

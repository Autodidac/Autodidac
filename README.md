# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Autodidac

ATTENTION ONE THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT I'M USING AI TO CREATE A MASSIVE REPO AND 90% OF THIS STUFF MIGHT BE INOPERABLE STATE RIGHT NOW.. BUT SOMEDAY I SHALL FINISH, STAY TUNED!

I've completely rebuilt the Job System and CrossView from the ground up and wor continues, Almond Engine is going to be released alpha 0.0.1 in the next few weeks, possibly without rendering even at first.
I just want to give a little update because the repos are a bit archaic at the moment.

Iâ€™m a passionate 40-something-year-old game developer with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Lua.

I specialize in contemporary C++ and enjoy working with C++20, eagerly anticipating C++23 with its exciting new features like modules. As an Autodidact Independent Game Developer, Iâ€™m currently leveraging **WickedEngine** for rendering, physics, scripting, networking, and audio in my projects.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and innovate through my projects. Some of the highlights include:

- **[Tree Geometry Generator](https://github.com/Autodidac/WickedTwoOLSystem)**: A system inspired by the concepts of SpeedTree, PlantFactory, and Lindenmayer Systems, designed for generating complex and realistic tree geometries.

- **[Free C++ Voxel Engine](https://github.com/Autodidac/CppVoxelEngine)**: A fully open-source voxel engine written in C++, allowing for the creation of dynamic, block-based worlds.

- **Modular System Development**: I love designing modular systems that seamlessly integrate and interact with each other, laying a strong foundation for future projects.

I am driven by a surge in productivity, thanks to a certain digital assistant that has been instrumental in making development life much more enjoyable.

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning

I thrive on learning new things and constantly improving my skills, especially in the realms of game development and high-performance programming. I'm always open to exploring cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of what can be achieved.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Continue expanding my knowledge in contemporary C++ and explore C++23's new features.
- Develop more sophisticated tools and engines for game development.
- Foster a community of like-minded developers to collaborate on exciting projects.

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Autodidac

Iâ€™m a passionate developer with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#
  
I specialize in contemporary C++ and enjoy working with C++20 and C++23.
Iâ€™m excited to tackle new challenges and work on innovative projects.

Such as my [Tree Geometry Generator](https://github.com/Autodidac/WickedTwoOLSystem) System based on the concepts of SpeedTree, PlantFactory, and Lindenmayer Systems.

Or my work on a [Free C++ Voxel Engine](https://github.com/Autodidac/CppVoxelEngine). And more...

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!

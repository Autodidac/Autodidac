# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Autodidac

Iâ€™m a passionate developer with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Etc...
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Lua.
  
I specialize in contemporary C++ and enjoy working with C++20 and looking forward to C++23 with modules.

Iâ€™m excited to tackle new challenges and work on innovative projects.

Such as my [Tree Geometry Generator](https://github.com/Autodidac/WickedTwoOLSystem) System based on the concepts of SpeedTree, PlantFactory, and Lindenmayer Systems.

Or my work on a [Free C++ Voxel Engine](https://github.com/Autodidac/CppVoxelEngine). And so much more, some even lost to time...

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!

Iâ€™m A Passionate Autodidactic Xennial Independent C++ Game Dev and Tuber with experience in:

- **Web Design**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python, Lua.

I specialize in C++ Game Engine and Game Design and eagerly anticipate C++23 with its exciting new features like modules. As an Independent Game Developer, I am now well on my way building my own open source free game engine for use in my projects and everyone else's!

### ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and innovate through my projects. Some of the highlights include:

- **[CrossView](https://github.com/Autodidac/CrossView)**: A Bare Bones Crossplatform Entrypoint Library
  
  A system similar to xwindow in the spirit of Modern C++ as a core crossplatform software development base. (vc studio + vs code)


---
- ---|| **[Almond Core](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondCore)**:

 A system inspired by allowing others to create beautiful things with the core of a game engine and allow them to create their own rendering systems while leveraging the power of Almond Engine.
 

---

- -------|||  **[Almond Shell](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondShell)**:
                    
A system inspired by the concepts of Java JRE, AutoRun executables, Ultimate X Programs, and Modular systems, Almond Core + A Plugin Mod System to disable the limits of creativity with Almond Engine and Almond Core.
                     

---

- -----------|||| **[Almond Engine](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondEngine)**:

 An x64-bit Cross platform functional header-only style C++20 Ultra Modern 4D (Time-based) Modular Game Engine and C++ cross editor build system. For literally everyone to use freely for everything, forever!

- â””â”€â”€ [a basic c++ repo template](https://github.com/Autodidac/cpp_repo_template)

I am driven by a surge in productivity, thanks to a certain digital assistant that has been instrumental in making development life much more enjoyable.

### ðŸŒ± Always Learning

I thrive on learning new things and constantly improving my skills, especially in the realms of game development and high-performance programming. I'm always open to exploring cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of what can be achieved.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Continue expanding my knowledge in contemporary C++ and explore C++23's new features.
- Develop more sophisticated tools and engines for game development.
- Foster a community of like-minded developers to collaborate on exciting projects.
